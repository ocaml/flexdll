- (dist) add version.rc to the source release
- Allow "/link XXX" as an equivalent to "-link XXX" (or "/linkXXX")
- Use an explicit .def file under MinGW and Cygwin to force the two symbols reloctbl and symtbl to be exported
- Fixes for x64

Version 0.19
- fix bug introduced in version 0.17 about virtual addresses for the builtin
  linker mode

Version 0.13, released on 2008-11-20
- another technique to work around the lack of response file for gcc:
  put the command line in an external bash script and apply bash to it
  (relies on the fact that Cygwin programs can call Cygwin programs
  with long command lines); this idea is from Xavier Leroy
- the -subsystem switch is now supported for the mingw toolchain

Version 0.12, released on 2008-11-17
- gcc 3 does not support response files; to support longer command lines, we use a
  custom replacement for cmd.exe (which restricts the length of the command line
  to 8kB whereas Windows supports 32kB)
- patch for Richard Jones: do not find directories when looking for a file

Version 0.11, released on 2008-11-10
