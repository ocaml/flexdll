Next version
- GPR#127: Recognise hyphens in option names in the COFF .drectve section. Fixes #126 (Reza Barazesh)
- GPR#140: Do not try to use `cygpath` by default with the MSVC toolchain. Fixes #139 (Nicolás Ojeda Bär)

Version 0.43
- GPR#108: Add -lgcc_s to Cygwin's link libraries, upstreaming a patch from the
  Cygwin flexdll package (David Allsopp)
- GPR#112: Put error global variables into thread-local storage (Samuel Hym, Nicolás Ojeda Bär)
- GPR#114: Support for /alternatename directive. Fixes GPR#113 (Jonah Beckford)
- GPR#116: Remove Cygwin32 (David Allsopp)
- GPR#117: Fix handling of object names of length > 16 in archive files. Fixes GPR#101 (Nicolás Ojeda Bär)
- GPR#118: Defer the detection of cygpath to the first time it's actually
  required, reducing the overall number of calls. Further, detect whether
  mingw-w64 gcc's library path requires cygpath, which further reduces the
  calls when using Cygwin's build of mingw-w64 as the search path is then
  converted only once. In passing, this trivially adds support for MSYS2's
  mingw-w64 compilers, fixing GPR#97. (David Allsopp)

- GPR#88: Correctly handle relative search paths coming from gcc -print-search-dirs (Boris Yakobowski)

Version 0.13, released on 2008-11-20
- another technique to work around the lack of response file for gcc:
  put the command line in an external bash script and apply bash to it
  (relies on the fact that Cygwin programs can call Cygwin programs
  with long command lines); this idea is from Xavier Leroy
- the -subsystem switch is now supported for the mingw toolchain

Version 0.12, released on 2008-11-17
- gcc 3 does not support response files; to support longer command lines, we use a
  custom replacement for cmd.exe (which restricts the length of the command line
